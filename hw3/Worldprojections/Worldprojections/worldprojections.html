    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>To display the map in different projections, I used the projection button on the bottom right to search for different projections. 
    From there, I simply clicked on each projection I wanted to use.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this map, the shape and area of the indicator circles is accurate near the equator, but it worsens as the longitude gets further from zero. This map preserves distance well.</h3>

    <img src=".//maps/4326.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map also preserves shape and distance well near the equator, but fails to do so as the longitude gets further from zero. However, this one is skewed vertically instead of horizontally.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
