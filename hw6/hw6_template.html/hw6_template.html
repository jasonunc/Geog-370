<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Jason Kennedy</h2>
<h3>This is a map of the aggregate monthly owner costs in Pennsylvania, I believe in 2021. My map is split up by county, so each county is a different color based on the aggregate monthly owner cost. In simple terms, the aggregate monthly owner cost is the total amount of money spent on housing (mortgage, deeds, insurance, etc.) per month in each county.</h3>
