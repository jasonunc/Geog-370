        <h3>Description of Map</h3>
        <p>
    I am personally a tour guide for Undergraduate Admissions and this is the route we take in order to give prospective students a good feel of Carolina.
    Each of the labels on the stops are what we talk about at each place. The stops are indicated by the yellow dots and the route is indicated by the blue line.
    The internet vector data used was a shapefile from UNC's GIS Service and highlights what is campus property at around 50% opacity.
    I know this may have been more points than intitially requested, but I was having trouble intitially figuring out what I would like to do. So I thought to do this as I work in the office just about everyday.
